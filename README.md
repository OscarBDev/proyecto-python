# Maching Learning, Flask and Data Base mySQL

## Getting Started

In order to view the project locally on your machine, a virtual environment must be created:

```
cd address of your folder
```

```
python -m venv environment_name
```
## We activate the virtual environment
```
environment_name\Scripts\activate
```
## The command line should look like this:
```
(environment_name) C:\address of your folder
```
## download flask
```
pip install flask
```
See also the guide [Flask installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/).
## Download the following as well
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
flask run
```
